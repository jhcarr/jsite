  <h1>Navigation in Mobile Virtual Environments</h1>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    The dream of ubiquitous virtual reality (VR) tools has been a
    powerful presence in pop culture
    since before the turn of the century. But for all of its charm, VR
    applications are few and far between
    due to the high cost of hardware setups and cumbersome form factor.
    This project investigates the
    possibility of bringing VR concepts to mobile devices, which have
    become relatively inexpensive,
    travel-savvy computing platforms that are capable of displaying 3D
    graphics at interactive speeds. The
    investigation examines related work in the context of the VR
    community's evolving ontology and
    taxonomy, builds and tests an example VR interface that leverages the
    user's kinesthetic sense modality,
    and discusses a plan for future study.
